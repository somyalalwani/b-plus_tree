# B+ Tree Implementation

### (used in the SQL range queries)

### Programming Languages Used â€‹: C++

### Implementation:

1. Implemented a B+ tree to handle the following type of queries


    a. INSERT X - insert X into the B+ tree
  
    b. FIND X - print YES if X is already inserted, else NO
   
    c. COUNT X - print number of occurrences of X in B+tree
  
    d. RANGE X Y - print number of elements in range x to y (both x and y included)


2. Constraints:
  
    a. -10^9 <= X <= 10^9, -10^9 <= Y <= 10
  
   b. The number of queries will be less than 10^6.

3. order of B+ Tree is 3.

### Input:

1. The input argument consists of a file name.
2. Each line in the file consists of one of the above-mentioned queries.

### Output:

1. Write outputs of the corresponding queries in a separate file or command-line.
